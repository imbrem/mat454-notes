\section*{Theorems of Montel and Picard}

\subsection*{Picard's Big Theorem}

Picard's big theorem says that in the neighborhood of an essential singularity a holomorphic function omits at most one complex value. That is,
\begin{theorem}[Picard's Big Theorem]
If \(z_0\) is an isolated essential singularity of a holomorphic function \(f(z)\), then \(f\) takes every complex value with one possible exception in any neighborhood \(\Omega\) of \(z_0\), i.e. \(\#(\mbb{C}\setminus f(\Omega)) \leq 1\).
\end{theorem}
So, is this \textit{really} the best possible statement of this kind: that is, is it really possible that a complex function can omit one possible value? Yes: for example, \(e^{1/z} \neq 0\), so it omits value \(0\) even though it has an essential singularity at the origin.

So, there's also Picard's Little Theorem:
\begin{theorem}[Picard's Little Theorem]
A non-constant entire function \(f\) omits at most a point, i.e. \(\#(\mbb{C}\setminus f(\mbb{C})) \leq 1\)
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
So why does Picard's Little Theorem follow from Picard's Big Theorem (of course, Picard proved the little theorem first)? Well, either \(\infty\) is a pole or it is an essential singularity.
\begin{itemize}

  \item If \(\infty\) is a pole, by the fundamental theorem of algebra we have that \(f\) is a polynomial (since there are no poles at any finite points). So in this case, it does take \textit{every} value.

  \item If \(\infty\) is an essential singularity, then we can apply Picard's Big Theorem to a neighborhood of \(\infty\).

\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
So, we're going to prove Picard's big theorem using the theory of normal families, and in fact we're going to deduce it as well as a closely related, very strong theorem by Montel, from a strange lemma. This is going to be a necessary and sufficient condition for normality, but we'll express it as a necessary and sufficient condition for \textit{failure} of normality:
\begin{lemma}[Zalcman's Lemma]
Let \(\mc{S}\) be a family of meromorphic functions on a domain \(\Omega\). \(f\) is \underline{not} normal in the chordal metric if and only if there is a convergent sequence \(\{a_n\} \to a_\infty \in \Omega\), a convergent sequence of positive numbers \(\{\rho_n\} \to 0\) and a sequence of functions \(\{f_n\} \subset \mc{S}\) such that the sequence
\[g_n(z) = f_n(a_n + \rho_n z)\]
converges uniformly to \(g\) in the chordal metric on compact subsets of \(\mbb{C}\) where \(g\) is nonconstant and meromorphic on all of \(\mbb{C}\).
\end{lemma}

\end{document}
